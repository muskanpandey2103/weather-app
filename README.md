## 🧠 What I Learned

1. ⚙️ **API Integration**  
   - Learned how to fetch and use data from an external API using `fetch()` and `async/await`.

2. 🌍 **Handling JSON Data**  
   - Extracted and used data like temperature, humidity, and weather condition from JSON response.

3. 🧾 **DOM Manipulation**  
   - Dynamically updated the UI using `textContent` and `innerHTML`.

4. 💅 **Styling with CSS**  
   - Created a responsive, centered layout with Flexbox.  
   - Used transitions and hover effects to improve interactivity.

5. 🧪 **Form Handling in JavaScript**  
   - Captured form submissions using `addEventListener`.  
   - Prevented default behavior to handle logic with JavaScript.

6. ❌ **Error Handling**  
   - Used `try...catch` blocks to manage failed API calls gracefully (though this can be further improved).
